## Personal Statement

I am an enthusiastic and thorough software developer looking for a role where I can continue to grow my expertise in TDD, Typescript and Java. In my role I want to contribute to a culture focused on learning and craftsmanship within a medium sized team that practices agile and high quality testing. Colleagues might describe me as a team player and that I am creative  and committed.

I graduated from Makers Academy in 2017, described by Forbes as "Londonâ€™s leading software development boot camp". Following graduation from the rigorous Codurance Academy, I have now built a serverless solution for data transfer and translation from Contentful CMS to MARC [here](https://marc.digitaltheatreplus.com/). I am now working as a Business Analyst for a large [EMR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7043175/) refactoring project.

For my first job after graduation from Makers, I joined a SAAS on-line real estate management company as a developer working with a talented team of ten. In this role I worked on perfecting my web development skills with Ruby and Rails by taking more challenging projects over time. I continued to improve my style of programming - with elements of TDD, OOP and refactoring - and my knowledge of the Ruby eco-system by reading open source library code and building my own. We also worked extensively on APIs, improving tests quality and coverage, and complex Rails upgrades.

Before switching career, I was working as a languages teacher and college lecturer where I practiced and honed my people skills, communication skills, attention to detail and strong work ethic. I particularly enjoyed teaching Ancient Greek, producing online lessons and organising a series of lectures on Herodotus.

__Tech Skills__: Typescript, React, Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, JavaScript, React, Jest, SQL, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, AWS, Docker, Ansible.
