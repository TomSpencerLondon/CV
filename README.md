I am a teacher now moving into Coding and training on the intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersademy). I am running a coding blog and a youtube site directed towards sharing lessons I have picked up on my coding journey.

My varied work experience and interests enhance my understanding of the world and I have now developed a positive attitude to work which I continue to build on using research on learning and also on productivity. My undergraduate and postgraduate study may seem like an unusual combination, but I have always had an aptitude for working with computers and my teaching practice has enabled me to explore online learning systems for young people including setting up a youtube site and website for my students. My success in undergoing the transition from teacher to coder is further evidence of my ability to work hard, learn rapidly, and adapt.

From my rich employment history I have gained a diverse set of skills, which equip me to be a versatile employee. My experience in teaching and working with colleagues has helped develop my organisational, communication and interpersonal skills, meaning I am able to step into the leadership role when it is required of me but am equally comfortable assisting my colleagues to achieve a common goal. I believe my nontraditional career path allows me to approach this role from a unique perspective and use my creativity as an advantage. I look forward to hearing from you.

## Skills

- **Communication** - Throughout my career I have focussed on being an effective communicator. Teaching Ancient Greek, Latin and French to a wide range of students from varied walks of life has taught me the importance of clarity and careful explanation to ensure understanding.

- **Enthusiastic** - Whilst at Makers Academy I have maintained a [blog](https://medium.com/@tomspencer_uk) about learning to code. I have also taken an active role in workshops and in the tech community more generally with regular attendance and contribution to the Codecademy meet-up at CitizenM.

- **Team-player** - I am a keen team player and am have been frequently praised for my cheerful and engaging interaction with fellow colleagues. The head master at my last school said: "It has been a real pleasure working with you over the last couple of years and you will be missed. I hope it all goes well with your new venture and that you will keep in touch."

- **Commitment** - Frequently praised for my "superhuman efforts" I am a diligent and conscientious worker and was praised for my 100% A-C grade results for my Latin GCSE class.

- **Curious** - I love learning and Makers Academy has made me more committed to developing my growth mindset on my journey to code craftsmanship.

- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I see these as opportunities as opposed to problems. In my role as a teacher I have worked with a huge diversity of people and settings. There is always a way to connect.

- **Creative** - During my teaching career I was always looking for new ways to help students to help students to study and developed a youtube channel for students to access outside of school.
