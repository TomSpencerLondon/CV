* Praised for my "superhuman efforts" I am a diligent and conscientious worker and achieved A-C grade results for my Latin GCSE class.

#### Adaptable 
New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I see these as opportunities as opposed to problems. In my role as a teacher I worked with a huge diversity of people and settings.
