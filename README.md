## About 

After retraining to become a developer, at my current company Homeflow I have continued to deepen my interest and expertise in coding through a determined, enthusiastic and carefully considered approach. This mid-sized SAAS company has allowed me to work on APIs, Rails and RSpec testing on a broad code base. Lead developer, Bob Farrell, creator of bpython (https://github.com/bpython/bpython) and keen open source contributor (https://github.com/bobf?tab=repositories), has proven to be an excellent mentor and I have seized this opportunity to sharpen my craft. At Homeflow I have: 
* become responsible for our property feeds application which interacts with several property based APIs including Reapit. 
* upgraded our google analytics application to Rails 5.2.
* worked in dev-ops with growing expertise in Ansible and Docker. 
* shared knowledge with recent new recruits. 
* continued to develop my coding and communication skills with outside projects and regular contribution to our weekly in-house code club (Fridays - 15.00).

As a languages teacher and college lecturer I explored online learning systems and built electronic study resources for my own students, including a website and ran an after-school coding club. I am well-organised, inventive, experienced in team working and a good communicator.

__Tech Skills__: OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Rspec, JavaScript, React, Jest, SQL, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, AWS, Docker, Ansible.

* Curious: [podcast](https://makersacademy.podbean.com/) documenting my journey through Makers Academy. 
* Original: My PhD on Augustan literature at Bristol was commended for its "original contribution" to Classical studies drawing, as it did, on contemporary literary and philosophical sources.  


#### Enthusiastic
* Home coding projects to develop more understanding of DSL and coding patterns.
* Shared experiences: [blog](https://medium.com/@tomspencer_uk) about learning to code. 
* Interested: Google campus hackathon, Brighton Ruby Conference.

#### Team-player
* Homeflow code-club organiser (Fridays 15:00).
* Head of the Classics Department at my secondary school and part of a team in Modern Languages. 
* As an experienced jazz trumpeter I worked with the music department to establish a flourishing jazz ensemble, orchestra and choir.

#### Committed
* Homeflow mentor praised my "diligence and perseverence" and code that is always "by the book".
* Praised for my "superhuman efforts" I am a diligent and conscientious worker and achieved A-C grade results for my Latin GCSE class.

#### Adaptable 
New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I see these as opportunities as opposed to problems. In my role as a teacher I worked with a huge diversity of people and settings. In my role as a coder I have learnt the importance of silent introspective diligence within a team environment. There is always a way to connect.
