I am a qualified and experienced Classics and Modern Languages teacher currently training on the intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersademy). Building on my work as a scholar of linguistics, I am now enthusiastically engaging with the discipline of computer languages. My coding [blog](https://medium.com/@tomspencer_uk) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l7ubsZwRwg&t=1s) site document my reflections on the intellectual and practical lessons learned as I make this transition.

## Skills

- **Communicator** - Teaching Ancient Greek, Latin and French to a wide range of students from varied walks of life has taught me the importance of clarity and careful explanation to ensure understanding.

- **Enthusiastic** - Whilst at Makers Academy I have maintained a [blog](https://medium.com/@tomspencer_uk) about learning to code. I have also taken an active role in workshops and in the tech community more generally with regular attendance and contribution to the Codecademy meet-up at CitizenM and attendance at Hackathons.

- **Team-player** - I was the head of the Classics Department at my secondary school but also worked as part of a team in Modern Languages. As an experienced jazz trumpeter I worked with the music department to establish a flourishing jazz ensemble, orchestra and choir.

- **Committed** -  Praised for my "superhuman efforts" I am a diligent and conscientious worker and achieved A-C grade results for my Latin GCSE class.

- **Creative** - My PhD on Augustan literature at Bristol was commended for its "original contribution" to Classical studies drawing, as it did, on contemporary literary and philosophical sources.  

- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I see these as opportunities as opposed to problems. In my role as a teacher I have worked with a huge diversity of people and settings. There is always a way to connect.
