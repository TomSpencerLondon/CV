## About 

I have an aptitude for working with computers. As a languages teacher and college lecturer I explored online learning systems and built electronic study resources for my own students, including a website. I ran an after-school coding club. I am well-organised, inventive, experienced in team working and a good communicator.

At Homeflow I have continued to deepen my interest and expertise in coding through a determined, enthusiastic and carefully considered approach. I very much enjoy working at a mid-sized SAAS company and working there has allowed me to work on APIS, Rails and RSpec testing in particular. Lead developer, Bob Farrell, creator of bpython (https://github.com/bpython/bpython) and keen open source contributor (https://github.com/bobf?tab=repositories), has proven to be an excellent mentor and I have seized this opportunity to sharpen my craft. I am also generous in sharing knowledge through my work with recent new recruits and I continue to develop my coding and communication skills with regular contribution to our weekly in-house code club (Fridays - 15.00).

__Tech Skills__: OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Rspec, JavaScript, React, Jest, SQL, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Version Control

## Skills

#### Creativity
I have designed, communicated and effectively delivered Latin, French and Ancient Greek lessons to a wide range of students from school to retirement age. I also organised [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM4ScXd5CkA&list=PLhhkrQZ2EUKwmtj99Xz95r6rpRnGZ5Brb&index=21) with 200 videos to front-load my lessons for student understanding. I also took part in a [podcast](https://makersacademy.podbean.com/) documenting my journey through Makers Academy. My PhD on Augustan literature at Bristol was commended for its "original contribution" to Classical studies drawing, as it did, on contemporary literary and philosophical sources.  


#### Enthusiastic 
Whilst at Makers Academy I have maintained a [blog](https://medium.com/@tomspencer_uk) about learning to code. I have also taken an active role in workshops and in the tech community more generally with regular attendance and contribution to the Codecademy meet-up at CitizenM and attendance at Hackathons.

#### Team-player 
I was the head of the Classics Department at my secondary school but also worked as part of a team in Modern Languages. As an experienced jazz trumpeter I worked with the music department to establish a flourishing jazz ensemble, orchestra and choir.

#### Committed  
Praised for my "superhuman efforts" I am a diligent and conscientious worker and achieved A-C grade results for my Latin GCSE class.

#### Adaptable 
New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I see these as opportunities as opposed to problems. In my role as a teacher I have worked with a huge diversity of people and settings. There is always a way to connect.
