## Profile

A software engineer with 6+ years of experience transitioning into technical business analysis. I combine strong analytical skills (PhD-trained) with hands-on technical expertise in enterprise software delivery. Experienced in client-facing consulting, requirements gathering, and translating complex business logic into technical solutions. Currently developing expertise in knowledge graphs and AI-powered decision systems.

## Relevant Experience

**Capgemini / UK Home Office (Regulus Project)** – *Software Engineer*
_May 2025 – Present_

- Designed and implemented business rule validation workflows for user authorisation, including role-based access control and organisation-level permission checks
- Created SQL repository patterns modelling complex entity relationships (users, organisations, visualisations, assignments) – directly transferable to knowledge graph structures
- Developed schema validation using Python dataclasses, ensuring data consistency across distributed services
- Fixed critical production issues requiring systematic debugging of complex logic flows
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams (security, data, platform) to refine shared architecture

**Capgemini / DEFRA** – *Software Engineer*
_February 2023 – May 2025_

- Delivered digital transformation solutions for DEFRA's NIRMS export applications
- Worked with event-driven architecture (Azure Service Bus) – similar patterns to knowledge graph event processing
- Built modular systems with clear separation of business logic and technical implementation

**Codurance** – *Software Consultant*
_March 2020 – January 2023_

- **Healthcare domain experience**: Delivered FHIR-based interoperability solutions for a large US Electronic Medical Records provider
- **Client-facing consulting**: Conducted requirements workshops with healthcare domain experts to understand clinical workflows
- **Structured data modelling**: FHIR standard represents healthcare entities (Patient, Condition, Medication, Practitioner) and their relationships – conceptually similar to knowledge graph design
- Translated complex clinical business rules into technical specifications
- Collaborated directly with client developers and business stakeholders to ensure project success

**Homeflow** – *Software Developer*
_March 2018 – February 2020_

- Developed APIs for real estate platform, modelling property, agent, and customer relationships
- Improved system quality through TDD and structured approach to problem-solving

## Why Technical Business Analysis?

My career has evolved from academia (PhD) through teaching to software engineering. At each stage, I've combined analytical thinking with the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.

At Codurance, I discovered I most enjoy the intersection of technical implementation and business understanding – conducting client workshops, gathering requirements, and translating domain knowledge into working solutions. The Technical BA role allows me to leverage both my engineering background and analytical strengths.
