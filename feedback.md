## Regulus / UK Home Office Project

### Dev Team Lead Feedback

Tom has been an absolute pleasure to work with on the project I managed. He's a hardworking and reliable software engineer who can always be trusted to deliver high-quality work without needing close supervision. Tom consistently takes initiative if he spots something that doesn't look right, he raises it proactively and often goes the extra mile to help find a solution.

He's also someone who's eager to pick up additional work and contribute wherever he can, which has made him a real asset to the team. Overall, Tom is trustworthy, proactive, and great to work with I'd happily work with him again on any future projects.

### Team Member Feedback

I have been collaborating with Tom for almost a year as part of a Home Office project, and he has been an skilled and knowledgeable team member. His skills in programming and software development have been immensely helpful to the team and he has been a fantastic team player who has worked with me on completing multiple software components. He is always happy to share his knowledge and help the other devs.
